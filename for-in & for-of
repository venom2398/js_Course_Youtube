In JavaScript, both `for-in` and `for-of` loops are used to iterate over elements, but they are used in different contexts and have distinct behaviors:

1. `for-in` loop
- Purpose: Used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object or an array.
- Use case: It loops through the property names (keys) of an object.

Example: Iterating over an object's properties
javascript
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  profession: "Developer"
};

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
}

Output:

name: Alice
age: 30
profession: Developer

Here, the `for-in` loop iterates over the keys (`name`, `age`, `profession`) of the `person` object.

2. `for-of` loop
- Purpose: Used to iterate over the values of an iterable object, such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, or other iterable objects.
- Use case: It loops through the values directly.

Example: Iterating over an array's values
javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}

Output:

red
green
blue

Here, the `for-of` loop iterates over each value in the `colors` array.

Differences between `for-in` and `for-of`
1. Use with Objects:
   - `for-in` works well for objects since it iterates over property keys.
   - `for-of` does not directly work with objects unless they are converted to an iterable format.

2. Use with Arrays:
   - `for-in` should generally be avoided with arrays because it iterates over indices (which might include non-numeric properties if added).
   - `for-of` is better suited for arrays because it directly iterates over array values.


Summary:
- Use `for-in` when iterating over the properties of an object.
- Use `for-of` when iterating over the values of an iterable like an array, string, map, or set.
