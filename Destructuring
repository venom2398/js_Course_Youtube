Destructuring is a powerful syntax in JavaScript that allows you to unpack values from arrays or objects into individual variables in a concise and readable manner. 
It simplifies the process of extracting data from complex data structures, making your code more expressive and easier to understand.

1) Destructuring Object
const a = {
  name:"basava",
  age:23
}
const {name} = a;
console.log(name) 
---------------
2) Destructuring array
const arr = [20,30,40];

const [a1,b1,c1] = arr;

console.log(a1,b1,c1)
