A closure in JavaScript is a feature where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables, even after the outer function has finished executing.

const baker = () =>{
	const price = 50
  function assistant(qun){
  	return `Total: ${price*qun}`
  }
  return assistant;
}

const myProduct = baker();
console.log(myProduct(4));
