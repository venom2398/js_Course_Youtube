Currying in JavaScript is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of nested functions, each taking a single argument. 
This means that instead of calling a function with all its arguments at once, you call it with one argument at a time, each returning a new function that takes the next argument.

1) normal technique:-

const cart=(price,quntity, discount)=>{
    	return (price * quntity) - discount;
}

const myProducts = cart(500,5,1000);
console.log(myProducts)
------------------
2) currying technique:-

const cart=(price)=>{
	return (quntity)=>{
  	return (discount) =>{
    	return (price * quntity) - discount;
    }
  }
}

const myProducts = cart(500)(5)(1000);

console.log(myProducts) //1500
