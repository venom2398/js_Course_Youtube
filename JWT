A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a way to securely transmit information between two parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications. 

How JWT Works:
1.Structure: A JWT consists of three parts:
   -Header: Contains information about the type of token and the algorithm used to generate it (usually something like `HS256`).
   -Payload: Contains the data you want to share (like user information or permissions). This data is also called "claims."
   -Signature: This is created by combining the header, payload, and a secret key. The signature helps verify that the token hasn't been altered.

2.Process:
   - When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT using the user's details and a secret key.
   - This token is sent back to the user's browser and stored (usually in local storage or a cookie).
   - For every request the user makes to access protected resources, the token is sent along with the request.
   - The server then verifies the token's signature using the secret key to check if it's valid.

Why JWT is Used:
-Secure: Since the token is signed, you can be sure that the data hasn't been tampered with.
-Stateless: The server doesn't need to store tokens, which makes it scalable.
-Portable: JWTs are self-contained, meaning they carry all the information needed to understand and verify the token without additional database lookups.

Example Use Case:
- A user logs in to your website.
- Your server creates a JWT with the user's information.
- The server sends the token to the user's browser.
- The user’s browser stores the token and sends it with every request to access protected pages.
- The server checks the token to verify the user’s identity without needing to log in again.

JWTs are widely used because they are secure, efficient, and easy to implement.
