A pure function is a function that:
	• Always returns the same output for the same set of input parameters.
	• Has no side effects, meaning it does not modify any external state or variables.

function pureFunc(a,b){
	return a+b;
}

console.log(pureFunc(3,3));

/* ----- */

An impure function is a function that:
	• May produce different outputs even if the same inputs are provided.
	• Has side effects, meaning it modifies some state or interacts with the outside world (e.g., changing variables, making HTTP requests, writing to a database).

let a = 5;

function impureFunc(b){
	return a + b;
}

console.log(impureFunc(5));
